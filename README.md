sciencedirect-dl
================
## What does it? ##
This script downloads a book / journal from
www.sciencedirect.com and merges the downloaded
PDFs to one single PDF.

## What must be installed? ##
- python (2.7.3 used while developing)
- pdftk (binary path must be in PATH (environment variable))
- BeautifulSoup (the python lib)

## How does it work?
The script tells me this:
<pre>
usage: sciencedirect-dl.py [-h] url output

Download Script for www.sciencedirect.com

positional arguments:
  url         URL to the specific Book to download
  output      Filepath to save the output to (PDF)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
</pre>

## What's missing? ##
I use the Issues feature of GitHub to track stuff I haven't
done yet, so take a look there.
